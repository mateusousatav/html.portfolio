<h1>Mateus' Amazing Movie Ranking</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith</h3>

<p>Just an insane movie filled with plot twists and revelations that bring excitement to the audience.</p>

<h3>2. Harry Potter and the Chaimber of Secrets</h3>

<p>Again, a near-perfect movie that gives more light to the real villain of the Harry Potter franchise.</p>

<h3>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>

<p>I love adventure movies and this is the perfect one. The whole scene with Gandalf and the Balrog makes my skin rise every time I watch.</p>
